# ESG in URLs: A Novel ESG Measure (In Progress)

For my master thesis at the Norwegian School of Economics, I created a novel ESG measure for a set of approx 500 firms listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq.
This repository contains the program I built in R to calculate this measure.

The measure is calculated by performing textual analysis of firms URLs gathered from the Wayback Machine.
